# Hotel System
Welcome to the Hotel Booking Management System project! Our system is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing hotel reservations and empowering receptionists with efficient tools. This project aims to streamline the booking process, enhance customer service, and simplify the management of room bookings within a hotel environment.

## Features
**1- Secure Login:** We have implemented a robust login mechanism that ensures the security of your data. Receptionists are required to enter their unique username and password, which are authenticated against a secure database. This authentication process guarantees that only authorized personnel can access the system.

**2- Booking Rooms:** Our system's primary function is to enable receptionists to easily book rooms for guests. With a user-friendly interface, receptionists can check room availability, select suitable options based on guest preferences, and confirm bookings. This feature simplifies the reservation process, saving time and effort for both receptionists and guests.

**3- Room Information and Customer Details:** Our system provides receptionists with instant access to room information. They can retrieve details such as room number, book id, customer id, payment id, check in, check out,  and number of nights whenever needed. Furthermore, receptionists can conveniently access customer information associated with each booked room.

**4-Room Locking and Unlocking:** In certain situations, the receptionist may need to temporarily lock a room for maintenance or updates. Our system includes a room locking feature that allows receptionists to mark a room as unavailable for bookings. This ensures that no further reservations are made for that room during the specified period, facilitating uninterrupted maintenance work. Once the maintenance or updates are completed, the receptionist can also unlock the room from the same function, making it available for bookings again.

**5-Cancellation:** Guests occasionally need to cancel their bookings, and our system simplifies the cancellation process. Receptionists can efficiently manage cancellations.
